                            <img class="img_w_30 img_float_right" src="images/activity_musky.jpg" alt="Topology-aware registration overview" /> In this project, we develop a multi-robot(20) autonomous delivery framework, that works with husky robots from
                            ClearPath robotics, in a simulation environment. The robots called "Musky" could be access delivery and pickup locations via command line inputs and/or with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) , where they can be made to traverse
                            to a preset location to pick up an order from a restaurant and will deliver it to a preset delivery location. Our proposed Robotic delivery system consists of a fleet of husky robots parked at multiple base stations, Where
                            each base station is provided with a unique Base ID. The purpose of each station is to charge robots and act as a fulfillment center to process the order. Upon receiving the orders from customers, Our advanced Task Planner
                            algorithms take care of assigning delivery jobs to available Musketeers with sufficient charge to fulfill the order. Upon fulfillment of the order to the destination, The robotâ€™s destination location becomes the new source
                            location to process the new order. These operations are further continued and planned according to the task planner. We utilised ROS "move_base" framework for the navigation of the Musketeers to reach destination location.We
                            have used ROS "gmapping" package to create the local and global cost maps along with detecting obstacles. We developed multiple interfaces in order to interact with the user using kivy for creating the GUI and CLI for command
                            line input. This project is being developed using agile methodologies and test driven development. For more information about this project can be accessed at the github repository.

                            The input coordinates [X,Y,Z] are send as an input to the IK solver to get the output_joint_angles. We have created the FK solver in order to check for robot arm constraints are in the bias range or not. We use FK_solver in
                            order to check for the output_bias and to cancel out singularities of the robot arm. This software will compute the trajectory when you input your desired location which will return a vector of all the joint angles for the

                        <p>
                            Generating Machine code from Human Languages is a challenging problem. In this project I have used Neural Transformer to generate Python Source Code from a given English Description. I have used a custom dataset where each record starts with English Description
                            line starting with # character followed by python code. The dataset is available in link below:We develop a pipeline for creating different tokenizer for english and python's indentations. After the preprocessing of the dataset
                            , it is then divided into question-answers pairs (English and Python code). We used a encoder-decoder architecture based transformer which uses a special type of attention mechanism called self-attention.The word embeddings
                            of the input sequence are computed simultaneously along with positional encoding to get the positional information.The encoder takes the english words, create embeddings (pre-trained Glove embedding is used) and then pass through
                            all the encoder transformer layers to get the encoded output which is passed to decoder.For Decoder, the standard architecture is modified to include Output Type as one of input. So, inputs used are [ Output Python Token ,
                            Output Python Token Type , Position] , the embedding are created for all these three and then passed through masked multihead attention and Layer normalization layers, which is then combined with encoder output and passed through
                            the multihead attention layers and layer normalization layers followed by Feed Forward layer and then softmax is applied to get the final output.I have used Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss to measure the performance.This
                            is our best score ( BLEU ) after training for several epochs -| Test Loss: 0.125 | Test PPL: 1.133 |.

                            are used for obstacle avoidance; Raspberry pi is used as a server to take the inputs and predict the outcome after training through a neural network. â€¢ We use Opencv to optimize the weights by backpropagating the gradients.
                            Once we get the optimized weights, we can apply it to the model then the car can run autonomously.

                            legs which can operate on any terrain, can climb stairs and a 3 DOF Pan tilt camera used for visual support and can carry payload using the robotic arm from a shorter distance. It is controlled through a wireless joystick which
                            is attached with an in-built display for visual scope. The Project can be further developed by collaborating with drones for vision and path guidance to access inaccessible terrain and environments.
